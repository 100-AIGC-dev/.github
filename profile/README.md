# 💯 100-AIGC-dev

Welcome to 100-AIGC-dev, an experimental initiative dedicated to creating 100% AI-generated Minecraft plugins and mods.

Our mission is to push the boundaries of AI-assisted software development by building fully functional, innovative, and fun Minecraft extensions—with code written entirely by artificial intelligence. This organization explores how far generative AI can go in automating complex software systems, especially in the dynamic and creative world of Minecraft.

## 🔍 What We Do

- 🧠 AI-Generated Code Only  
  All code in this organization is written by generative AI with absolutly zero manual coding by humans.

- 🧩 Plugins & Mods  
  We focus on creating a variety of Minecraft experiences—ranging from utility plugins for Paper/Spigot servers to Forge/Fabric mods with completely new mechanics.

- 🧪 Open Source Experiments  
  Every project is open source and transparent. The goal is to learn, test, and showcase the real-world capabilities (and limitations) of AI-generated code.

---

## 🚀 Our Goals

- ✅ Prove that AI can autonomously generate entire Minecraft plugins and mods from scratch  
- ✅ Provide an educational resource for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts  
- ✅ Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based software generation  
- ✅ Explore best practices for AI-human collaboration in software engineering  

---

## 📦 Repositories

Each repo in this organization will:

- Be fully generated by AI (including design, structure, and logic)  
- Include detailed prompts and iteration logs (when applicable)  
- Be clearly labeled with version, target Minecraft version, and type (Plugin / Mod)  
- Include a README generated by AI, with human-curated instructions when necessary  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Minecraft Versions: Primarily 1.8.8, 1.12.2, 1.16.x, 1.20.x  
- Plugin API: PaperSpigot / Bukkit  
- Mod Loaders: Forge / Fabric (coming soon)  
- AI Models: OpenAI GPT, Claude, and other LLMs  
- Tooling: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and custom scripts to assist generation  

---

## 🙋 Want to Contribute?

This is a living lab for AI development. While the code itself is AI-written, human contributions are welcome in the form of:

- Project ideas and plugin/mod feature requests  
- Testing and issue reports  
- Prompt engineering and AI training ideas  
- Documentation help and structure improvements  

If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to open issues or join our discussions.
